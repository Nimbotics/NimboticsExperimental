# NimboticsExperimental
Here is the repo for small experimental files and libraries that may eventually get their own repo once they have become more fully 
developed. There is not a lot of documentation for this currently but that will improve in the future. I'm hoping that eventually 
to have a full suite of robotics libraries developed for nim so that nim can become a major language for both practical and
theoretical robotics work. Anyone that would like to help by creating pull requests or opening is welcome to and if anyone
wants to join the nimbotics organization they are also welcome to as this is a new organization I am trying to develop to
encourage more robotics libraries for nim in the future.
