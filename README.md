# nimbotics
Here is the beginnings of what I hope to be a full fledged robotics library designed in the nim language.
Currently there is a quaternion library, a 2d inkage library, and a small kalman filter. 
I plan on expandning this library over time with more libraries and examples of using robotics algorithms in nim.
if you would like to join the project or help and edit you can make an issue, create pull requests, or send me a message.
I appreciate any help I can get and would love to see nim become a major language in the field of robotics someday.
